#Fizz Buzz

##What is Fizz Buzz?

Fizz Buzz, if you're unsure, is a app, program, service (whatever buzz word happens to apply at this time) that does the following:

`Prints the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"`

Simple, right?!1

During the next couple steps feel free to ask any questions to clarify or get help.  Google, Yahoo!, Bing, whatever are also available for use.  Also, talk out loud as you solve the problem.  Your reasoning and thought process are what's most important here.
